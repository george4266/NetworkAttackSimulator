Below are some links to RL background info. I highly recommend watching the entire YouTube lecture series (eventually). If you prefer reading, the textbook is canonical. At the very least, I recommend reading Chapter 1 and 17.6. The YouTube channel "Two Minute Papers" has plenty of cutting-edge research summaries and is a good way to see the types of things researchers are currently working on. Lastly there is a coding exercise, which I recommend for those who learn by doing, otherwise jumping straight into the NetworkAttackSimulator (https://networkattacksimulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is another option to begin coding.

RL is a big topic and not easy to understand at first. Plan to iterate! You don't need to understand all the equations to start running code. Expect for it to take some time for your brain to start making the connections between the math, the code, the applications/use cases, the high-level vision, etc. As you run into questions, write them down, and we can cover them in our meetings.

There will be more background to learn on the cyber-side. The NetworkAttackSimulator documents are a good place to start. Academic literature will be shared as well, but for now, focus more on RL. Then we will fit cyber-topics into the RL worldview (e.g., understanding an attack graph in terms of an RL environment vs. in terms of cybersecurity).
